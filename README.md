# Overview:

A minimal [brainfuck](https://brainfuck.org/brainfuck.html) interpreter in Rust. It was built purely for fun.

> [!NOTE]
> Brainfuck, language itself, is a Turing-complete language created by Urban MÃ¼ller. The language only consists of 8 operators, yet with the 8 operators, `<>+-[],.` you are capable of writing almost any program you can think of.
